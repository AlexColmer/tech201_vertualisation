# DevOps and Development Environmetns 

## DevOps

DevOps are responsible to tying teams together in a development cycle 

- Ease of use

other teams are going to use the tools we create. They will not use them if they are not user freindly. if the devs donot use our tools then there will be headaches/delays in deployment down the line
- Flexibility 

It can be easy to get locked in to using a specific product, tool or software it then becomes hard for the company to keep up with industry changes. everything the company uses should be easily changed or updated as the buisness needs change
- Robustness

We need as close to 100% up time as possible for the companies services. We are respomsible for achieving this as DevOps engineers.
- Cost

Cost is often overlooked we need to make sure the company is being as efficient as possible in its tech dealings. For exmaple how powerful a machine do we need to conduct a task? do we need certain servers running? ect.
